# ECAT Marks Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for predicting Engineering College Admission Test (ECAT) marks using linear regression. The script utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks and pandas for data manipulation.

# Overview

The provided Python script performs the following tasks:

# Data Preparation:
Reads the dataset from a CSV file and preprocesses it by mapping categorical variables to numerical values and dropping unnecessary columns.

# Data Visualization:
Visualizes the correlation between different features using a heatmap.

# Model Training:
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets, then trains a linear regression model on the training data.

# Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the trained model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the testing set.

# Prediction:
Demonstrates how to predict ECAT marks for a hypothetical student based on their gender and academic performance.

# Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
