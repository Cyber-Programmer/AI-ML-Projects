This Python script utilizes linear regression to predict loan amounts based on applicant attributes. It:

- Handles data preprocessing tasks like handling missing values and converting categorical variables to numerical ones.
- Visualizes feature correlations using a heatmap.
- Selects relevant features and removes unnecessary ones.
- Trains a linear regression model and evaluates its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Demonstrates loan amount prediction for a sample input.
